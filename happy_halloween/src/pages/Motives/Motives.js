                                    such as the homeless, ex-cons, homosexuals, drug users, prostitutes, or people of

                                <p className="decription-of-hedonistic">This type of serial killer seeks thrills and derives pleasure 
                                    from killing, seeing people as expendable means to this goal. Forensic psychologists have 
                                    identified three subtypes of the hedonistic killer: "lust", "thrill", and "comfort".

                                <p className="decription-of-power">The main objective for this type of serial killer is 
                                    to gain and exert power over their victim. Such killers are sometimes abused as children, 
                                    leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. Many power- or 
                                    control-motivated killers sexually abuse their victims, but they differ from hedonistic 
                                    killers in that rape is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as 
                                    simply another form of dominating the victim.

                            <h2 className="lust-title">Lust</h2>
                                <p className="decription-of-lust">Sex is the primary motive of lust killers, whether or not the victims are 
                                    dead, and fantasy plays a large role in their killings. Their sexual gratification depends on the amount 
                                    of torture and mutilation they perform on their victims. The sexual serial murderer has a psychological 
                                    need to have absolute control, dominance, and power over their victims, and the infliction of torture, 
                                    pain, and ultimately death is used in an attempt to fulfill their need. They usually use weapons that 
                                    require close contact with the victims, such as knives or hands. As lust killers continue with their 
                                    murders, the time between killings decreases or the required level of stimulation increases, sometimes both.

                            <h2 className="thrill-title">Thrill</h2>
                                <p className="decription-of-thrill">The primary motive of a thrill killer is to induce pain or terror in 
                                    their victims, which provides stimulation and excitement for the killer. They seek the adrenaline rush 
                                    provided by hunting and killing victims. Thrill killers murder only for the kill; usually, the attack 
                                    is not prolonged, and there is no sexual aspect. Usually, the victims are strangers, although the killer 
                                    may have followed them for a period of time. Thrill killers can abstain from killing for long periods of 
                                    time and become more successful at killing as they refine their murder methods. Many attempt to commit 
                                    the perfect crime and believe they will not be caught.

                                <p className="decription-of-comfort">Material gain and a comfortable lifestyle are the primary motives of comfort 
                                    killers. Usually, the victims are family members and close acquaintances. After a murder, a comfort killer will 
                                    usually wait for a period of time before killing again to allow any suspicions by family or authorities to subside. 
                                    They often use poison, most notably arsenic, to kill their victims. Female serial killers are often comfort killers, 
                                    although not all comfort killers are female. Contract killers ("hitmen") may exhibit serial killers traits, but are 
                                    generally not classified as such because of third-party killing objectives and detached financial and emotional 
                                    incentives. Nevertheless, there are occasionally individuals that are labeled as both a hitman and a serial killer.
