    Little also drew detailed pictures of his victims, which the FBI has used to help solve the murders.

    believes each woman was from and Little's videotaped confessions. Detectives hope that with the 
    public's help and the information from Little, they can resolve the remaining 40 unresolved cases."

    his home and strangled them, then left them in woodsy, remote sites. The first few bodies turned 
    up along the now-notorious Green River. Dubbed the Green River Killer, Ridgway eluded the law 
    until 2001, when King County sheriff Dave Reichert, the first officer assigned to the case in 
    1982, called a meeting to re-examine evidence using newly developed DNA-testing technology. The 
    analysis produced a match between evidence from the victims and Ridgway, and he was charged with 
    four counts of aggravated murder in December 2001. Ridgway eventually pleaded guilty to 49 counts

    Harvey said he started out killing to 'ease the pain' of patients by smothering them with their 
    pillows. He mostly killed cardiac patients. Harvey used many methods to kill his victims, such 
    as: arsenic, cyanide, insulin, suffocation, miscellaneous poisons, morphine, turning off 
    ventilators, administration of fluid tainted with hepatitis B and/or HIV (which resulted in a 
    hepatitis infection, but no HIV infection, and illness rather than death), and insertion of a 
    coat hanger into a catheter, causing an abdominal puncture and subsequent peritonitis. Cyanide 
    and arsenic were his most-used methods, with Harvey administering them via food or injections. 
    The majority of Harvey's crimes took place at the Marymount Hospital (now St. Joseph's, London) 
    in London, Kentucky, the Cincinnati V.A. Medical Hospital, and Cincinnati's Drake Memorial Hospital. 
    At various times, he worked as an orderly or an autopsy assistant. Harvey did not limit his victims 
    to helpless hospital patients. When he suspected his lover and roommate of infidelity, he poisoned 
    his lover's food with arsenic. He poisoned two of his neighbors, sickening one, by putting hepatitis 
    serum in her drink, and killing the other, by putting arsenic in her pie. He also killed lover's 
    father with arsenic. Harvey kept his crimes from being discovered for 17 years"

    win the trust of victims and society. He would typically approach his victims in public places, 
    feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before knocking them 
    unconscious and taking them to secluded locations to rape and strangle them. He sometimes 
    revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until 
    putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. He decapitated
    at least 12 victims and kept some of the severed heads as mementos in his apartment. On a few 
    occasions, he broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept. In 1975, 
    Bundy was arrested and jailed in Utah for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. 
    He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in several states. 
    Facing murder charges in Colorado, he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults 
    in Florida, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in 1978. For the Florida homicides, 
    he received three death sentences in two trials. Bundy was executed in the electric chair at Florida 
    State Prison in Raiford, Florida, on January 24, 1989."
